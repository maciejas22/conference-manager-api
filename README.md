# Conference Manager API

This repository hosts the backend API of the Conference Management System, developed to facilitate seamless management and organization of conferences.

## Overview

The API is structured as a microservices architecture using modern web technologies. It efficiently handles business logic, user authentication, payments, and data management.

## Implementation and Architecture

The API follows a microservices architecture for modular and scalable backend management. The architecture is designed to support expanding functionalities with ease, leveraging the efficiency of Go for service implementation.

-  **Microservices Architecture**: Composed of distinct services handling authentication, conference management, and information retrieval.
-  **GraphQL Gateway**: Serves as a single entry point for client interactions, consolidating data requests across services.
-  **Security and Session Management**: Employs OAuth tokens and session management for secure interactions.
-  **Database Design**: Utilizes PostgreSQL with a focus on normalized data storage for efficient querying and data integrity.
-  **External Service Integration**: Integrates with Stripe for payments and Amazon S3 for file management.

## Features

-    User authentication and session management
-    Conference creation, update, and management
-    Ticket handling and validation
-    Secure payment processing using external services
